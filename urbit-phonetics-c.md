Use the Nock tree numbering to navigate a large branching tree of potential English sentences


To navigate a hand-pruned tree of all possible English phonetic sequences

Make like a hand-drawn Markov chain thing

s->(a e i o u t p k l b) etc
obviously different letters will have other letters which can follow them
this does not exclude us from having some two-byte things with two syllables, some with one etc
think large consonant clusters

might need a self-aware, two-layer aware chain (but this would break the tree numbering)

number one is memorability
number two is distance between words
